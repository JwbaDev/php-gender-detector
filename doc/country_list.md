## Country List

The original list of countries/regions introduced by the 'gender.c' program remains almost unchanged.

Some adjustments were made, such as separating grouped countries into aliases:
  - `india` and `sri_lanka` are aliases.
  - `kazakhstan`, `kyrgyzstan`, `tajikistan`, `turkmenistan`, `uzbekistan` are grouped.

Some country names were changed:
  - `macedonia` to `north_macedonia`.
  - `persia` to `iran`.

Note that some names are not actual countries (e.g., `arabia` or `east_frisia`), but they are still included in the list.

You can view the full list of countries [here](/src/Country.php).
